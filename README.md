# Week4Test
This test wqas to determine in an outbreak had occured in a set of rooms. There had to be 5 rooms cogurous as up, down, left, or right of one another. Diagonals were not considdered congrouous. My solution iterates through the array of rooms until it finds one that is "infected". It then recursively determins if there are five congrouous rooms. If there are, it prints out "THERE IS AN OUTBREAK!", if not, it prints out, "There is no outbreak."

The run pictured is from the verticalTrue array.
